# US Airports
This is my repository for a map and data which describe existing airports in the United States. The goal of this project is to provide the viewer with an aesthetically pleasing map of the geographical locations of airports in the US.

**Project Name**
*The Spatial Distribution of Public Airports in the United States*

**Major Functions**
1. Creates a pop-up window with the name of the airport when an airport is clicked.
2. Changes the point symbology of airports from generic markers to pictures of planes. Also, the changes the color of the marker to describe the presence/absence of a control tower at the airport.
3. Fills in state polygons with colors designated from a color ramp based on how many airports are within the state boundary.
4. A series of related functions designed to highlight a state when the mouse is hovered above it and to zoom in on the state boundary when clicked.
5. Creates and populates a legend.
